:description: Illustation how transactions are managed with the HTTP API.

[[http-api-actions-transaction-flow]]
= Transaction flow

Cypher transactions are managed over several distinct URIs that are designed to be used in a prescribed pattern.
Facilities are provided to carry out the full transaction cycle over a single HTTP request, or over multiple HTTP requests.

The overall flow is illustrated below, with each box representing a separate HTTP request:

[[http-api-actions-transaction-lifetime]]
== Transaction lifetime

The state of each transaction is maintained on the server on which the transaction began.
Transactions expire automatically after a period of inactivity.
By default this is `60` seconds.

To keep a transaction alive without submitting new queries, an empty statement list can be posted to the `/tx/\{n}` URI.
